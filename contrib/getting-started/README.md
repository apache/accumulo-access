# Getting started with Accumulo Access

This standalone Accumulo Access example has the following components.

 * [AccessExample](src/main/java/gse/AccessExample.java) Example that shows how to evaluate if data is accessible.
 * [pom.xml](pom.xml) Maven build file that shows how to use Accumulo Access as a dependency
 * [run.sh](run.sh) Bash script that runs the example

To run this example clone the Accumulo Access repository and then do the following.

```bash
cd accumulo-access
# This step installs a snapshot version of the Accumulo Access library.
# This step will not longer be needed once Accumulo Access is released.
mvn install
cd contrib/getting-started
# Build the example.  If you change the example java code, run this step again.
mvn clean package
# Run the example
./run.sh
```

## Example runs

Running with the authorizations set `{BLUE,GREEN,PINK,RED}` shows the complete data set because all data is accessible with these authorizations.

```
$ ./run.sh BLUE GREEN PINK RED
data1 : (RED&GREEN)|(BLUE&PINK)
data2 : (RED&GREEN)|(BLUE&PINK)
data3 : (RED|GREEN)&(BLUE|PINK)
data4 : (RED&GREEN)|(BLUE&PINK)
data5 : (RED|GREEN)&(BLUE|PINK)
data6 : 
data7 : PINK
data8 : RED&BLUE&GREEN&PINK
data9 : PINK|(BLUE&RED)
```

Running with the empty set of authorizations shows only `data6` which has an empty access expression and is always accessible with any authorization set.

```
$ ./run.sh 
data6 : 
```

Running with the authorizations set `{BLUE,RED}`

```
$ ./run.sh BLUE RED
data3 : (RED|GREEN)&(BLUE|PINK)
data5 : (RED|GREEN)&(BLUE|PINK)
data6 : 
data9 : PINK|(BLUE&RED)
```

Running with the authorizations set `{GREEN,RED}`

```
$ ./run.sh GREEN RED
data1 : (RED&GREEN)|(BLUE&PINK)
data2 : (RED&GREEN)|(BLUE&PINK)
data4 : (RED&GREEN)|(BLUE&PINK)
data6 : 
```

Running with the authorizations set `{PINK}`

```
$ ./run.sh PINK
data6 : 
data7 : PINK
data9 : PINK|(BLUE&RED)
```
