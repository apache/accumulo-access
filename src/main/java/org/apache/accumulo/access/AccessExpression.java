/**
 * This class offers the ability to validate, build, and normalize access expressions. An instance
 * of this class should wrap an immutable, validated access expression. If passing access
 * expressions as arguments in code, consider using this type instead of a String. The advantage of
 * passing this type over a String is that its known to be a valid expression.
 *
 * <p>
 * Below is an example of how to use this API.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // The following authorization does not need quoting
 * // so the return value is the same as the input.
 * var auth1 = AccessExpression.quote("CAT");
 *
 * // The following two authorizations need quoting and the return values will be quoted.
 * var auth2 = AccessExpression.quote("ðŸ¦•");
 * var auth3 = AccessExpression.quote("ðŸ¦–");
 *
 * // Create an AccessExpression using auth1, auth2, and auth3
 * var exp = "(" + auth1 + "&" + auth3 + ")|(" + auth1 + "&" + auth2 + "&" + auth1 + ")";
 *
 * // Validate the expression, but do not normalize it
 * System.out.println(AccessExpression.of(exp).getExpression());
 *
 * // Validate and normalize the expression.
 * System.out.println(AccessExpression.of(exp, true).getExpression());
 *
 * // Print the unique authorization in the expression
 * System.out.println(visExp.getAuthorizations());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above example will print the following.
 *
 * <pre>
 * (CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦–")|(CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦•"&amp;CAT)
 * ("ðŸ¦•"&amp;CAT)|("ðŸ¦–"&amp;CAT)
 * [ðŸ¦–, CAT, ðŸ¦•]
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following code will throw an {@link IllegalAccessExpressionException} because the expression
 * is not valid.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * AccessExpression.validate("A&B|C");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: The underlying implementation uses UTF-8 when converting between bytes and Strings.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo-access">Accumulo Access Documentation</a>
 * @since 1.0.0

   * <li>As an example of deduplication, the expression {@code X&Y&X} normalizes to {@code X&Y}</li>
   * <li>As an example of unneeded quotes, the expression {@code "ABC"&"XYZ"} normalizes to
   * {@code ABC&XYZ}</li>
   * <li>As an example of unneeded parentheses, the expression {@code (((ABC)|(XYZ)))} normalizes to
