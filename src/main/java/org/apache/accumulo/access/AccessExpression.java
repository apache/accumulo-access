 * An opaque type that contains a parsed access expression. When this type is constructed with
 * {@link #of(String)} and then used with {@link AccessEvaluator#canAccess(AccessExpression)} it can
 * be more efficient and avoid re-parsing the expression.
 *
 * Below is an example of using this API.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 * var auth1 = AccessExpression.quote("CAT");
 * var auth2 = AccessExpression.quote("ðŸ¦•");
 * var auth3 = AccessExpression.quote("ðŸ¦–");
 * var visExp = AccessExpression
 *     .of("(" + auth1 + "&" + auth3 + ")|(" + auth1 + "&" + auth2 + "&" + auth1 + ")");
 * System.out.println(visExp.getExpression());
 * System.out.println(visExp.normalize());
 * System.out.println(visExp.getAuthorizations());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above example will print the following.
 *
 * <pre>
 * (CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦–")|(CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦•"&amp;CAT)
 * ("ðŸ¦•"&amp;CAT)|("ðŸ¦–"&amp;CAT)
 * [ðŸ¦–, CAT, ðŸ¦•]
 * </pre>
