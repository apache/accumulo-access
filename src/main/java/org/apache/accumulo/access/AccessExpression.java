/**
 * A set of utility methods for operating on Access Expressions.
 *
 * Below is an example of using this API.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 * var auth1 = AccessExpression.quote("CAT");
 * var auth2 = AccessExpression.quote("ðŸ¦•");
 * var auth3 = AccessExpression.quote("ðŸ¦–");
 * var visExp = AccessExpression
 *     .of("(" + auth1 + "&" + auth3 + ")|(" + auth1 + "&" + auth2 + "&" + auth1 + ")");
 * System.out.println(visExp);
 * System.out.println(AccessExpression.getAuthorizations(visExp));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above example will print the following.
 *
 * <pre>
 * (CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦–")|(CAT&amp;"ðŸ¦•"&amp;CAT)
 * [ðŸ¦–, CAT, ðŸ¦•]
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following code will throw an {@link IllegalAccessExpressionException} because the expression
 * is not valid.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 * AccessExpression.validate("A&B|C");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo-access">Accumulo Access Documentation</a>
