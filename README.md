# Accumulo Access Control Library

This library is a stand-alone java library that provides the functionality of the Apache Accumulo ColumnVisibility for use outside of Accumulo.

## Concepts

 * AccessExpression - a boolean expression of attributes required to access an object (e.g. Key/Value pair in Accumulo). See SPECIFICATION.md.
 * Authorizations - a set of attributes, typically attributed to the entity trying to access an object.
 * AccessEvaluator - An object that determines if the entity can access the object using the entity's Authorizations and the objects AccessExpression.

## Goals

 * Create a standalone java library that offers the Accumulo visibility functionality
 * Support the same syntax and semantics as ColumnVisibility and VisibilityEvaluator initially.  This will allow ColumnVisibility and VisibilityEvaluator to adapt to use this new library for their implementation.
 * Have no dependencies for this new library
 * Use no external types (like Hadoop types) in its API.
 * Use semantic versioning.

## Public API

The following types constitute the public API of this library. All other types are package private and are not part of the public API.

  * [IllegalAccessExpressionException](src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/access/IllegalAccessExpressionException.java).
  * [AccessEvaluator](src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/access/AccessEvaluator.java).
  * [AccessExpression](src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/access/AccessExpression.java).
  * [Authorizations](src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/access/Authorizations.java).

For an example of using this library see the [unit test](src/test/java/org/apache/accumulo/access/AccessEvaluatorTest.java).

See the [specification](SPECIFICATION.md) for details about access expressions.

See the [getting started guide](contrib/getting-started/README.md) for a simple example of how to use this java library.
